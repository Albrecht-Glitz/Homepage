		</br><h2>The Geography of Refugee Shocks</h2></br>
	<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
	<b>Abstract:</b>
	This paper studies how refugee inflows affect receiving communities using highly disaggregated German administrative data at a 1km x 1km resolution. We develop a novel spatial equilibrium model that features two geographic levels, small neighborhoods and more aggregated local labor markets (LLMs). In the model, local displacement effects and impacts on house prices are closely linked to immigration-induced changes in neighborhood-level amenities and LLM-level productivity. Our empirical results show that refugee inflows lead to a less than one-for-one relative population relocation in neighborhoods, indicating that refugees have a positive impact on local amenities. We also find relocation on the LLM-level to be less than one-for-one, suggesting that refugees also positively impact local productivity.</br></br>

	<b>Abstract:</b>
	Espionage incurs important costs yet there is little quantitative evidence on how secret services and spies work, and under what conditions they perform well. We study this question using declassified archival data from one of the most prolific secret services worldwide, the East German <em>Stasi</em> during the Cold War. We analyze a unique database that contains information on all the pieces of information that spies in the West sent to East Germany between 1970 and 1989. We match a subset of spies to their West German social security records, allowing us to track their careers in the secret service and in the firms they were spying on simultaneously. Analyzing the quantity and quality of information delivered, we disentangle the roles that spy heterogeneity, learning-by-doing, and career progression in the espionage object play for spy performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for counter-espionage efforts today.</br></br>

	<b>Abstract:</b>
	Economic espionage is a pervasive global phenomenon. We study how this illicit activity affects the performance and production structures of firms in the perpetrating country. Exploiting historical data from East Germany that trace the flow of scientific-technical information from their sources in the West to their recipients in the East, we show that economic espionage increased firms’ output, productivity and exports. The results further suggests that the technical change induced by economic espionage was factor-neutral, and that the associated productivity gains propagated through the production network via input-output linkages. In the long run, a higher inflow of espionage information was associated with a higher likelihood of successful privatization following German reunification.</br></br>

		</br><h2>Immigration, Inequality and Income Taxes</h2></br>
	<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
	<b>Abstract:</b>
	Immigration may affect income inequality not only by changing factor prices but also by inducing policy makers to adjust the prevailing income tax system. We assess the relative importance of these <em>economic</em> and <em>political</em> channels using administrative data from Switzerland where local authorities have a high degree of tax autonomy. We show that immigrant inflows not only raise gross earnings inequality but also reduce the progressivity of local income taxes, further increasing after-tax inequality. Our estimates suggest that around 10 percent of the impact of immigration on the net interquartile and interdecile earnings gaps can be attributed to the <em>political channel</em>.</br></br>

	<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
	<b>Abstract:</b>
	This paper shows that the wage assimilation of immigrants is the result
	of the intricate interplay between individual skill accumulation and dynamic labor market equilibrium effects. When immigrants and natives
	are imperfect substitutes, rising immigrant inflows widen the wage gap
	between them. Using a production function framework in which workers
	supply both general and host-country-specific skills, we show that this labor
	market competition channel explains about one fifth of the large increase
	in the average immigrant-native wage gap across arrival cohorts in the
	United States since the 1960s. This figure increases to one third after also
	accounting for relative demand shifts due to technological change.</br></br>

</br><h2>Industrial Espionage and Productivity</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper, we investigate the economic returns to industrial espionage. We show that the flow of information provided by East German informants in the West over the period 1970–1989 led to a significant narrowing of sectoral TFP gaps between West and East Germany. These economic returns were primarily driven by relatively few high-quality pieces of information and particularly large in sectors closer to the West German technological frontier. Our findings suggest that the East-to-West German TFP ratio would have been 13.3 percent lower at the end of the Cold War had East Germany not engaged in industrial espionage in the West.</br></br>

		</br><h2>Learning Through Coworker Referrals</h2></br>
	<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
	<b>Abstract:</b>
	In this paper, we study the role of coworker referrals for labor market outcomes. Using
	comprehensive Danish administrative data covering the period 1980 to 2005, we first
	document a strong tendency of workers to follow their former coworkers into the same
	establishments and provide evidence that these mobility patterns are likely driven by
	coworker referrals. Treating the presence of a former coworker in an establishment at
	the time of hiring as a proxy for a referral, we then show that referred workers initially earn 4.6 percent higher wages and are 2.3 percentage points less likely to leave their employers than workers hired through the external market. Consistent with a theoretical	framework characterized by higher initial uncertainty in the external market but the possibility of subsequent learning about match-specific productivity, we show that these	initial differences gradually decline as tenure increases. We structurally estimate a stylized model using indirect inference and find that the noise of the initial signal about a worker’s productivity is 14.5 percent lower in the referral market than in the external market, and that firms learn about their workers’ true match-specific productivity with a probability of 48.4 percent per year. Counterfactual simulations show that average wages are lower in the	absence of a referral market, primarily because of lower average match productivity in the external market.

</br><h2>Skill Premiums and the Supply of Young Workers in Germany</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper, we study the development and underlying drivers of skill premiums in Germany between 1980 and 2008. We show that the significant increase in the medium-to-low skill premium since the late 1980s was almost exclusively concentrated among workers aged 30 or below. Using a nested CES production function framework which allows for imperfect substitutability between young and old workers, we show that changes in relative labor supplies can explain these patterns very well. A cohort-level analysis reveals that distinct secular changes in the educational attainment of the native population are the primary source of the declining relative supply of medium-skilled workers in Germany. Low-skilled immigration, in contrast, only plays a secondary role in explaining the rising lower-end wage inequality in Germany over recent decades.</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
We analyze how the formal recognition of foreign qualifications affects immigrants' labor market outcomes. The empirical analysis is based on a novel German data set that links respondents' survey information to their administrative records, allowing us to observe immigrants at monthly intervals before, during, and after their application for occupational recognition. We find that 3 years after obtaining recognition, immigrants earn 19.8% higher wages and are 24.5 percentage points more likely to be employed than immigrants in the control group. We further document that occupational recognition leads to full convergence of immigrants' earnings to those of their native counterparts.

</br><h2>Coworker Networks in the Labour Market</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent">
<p><b>Abstract:</b>
This paper studies the effect of coworker-based networks on individual labour market outcomes. I analyse how the provision of labour market relevant information by former coworkers affects the employment probabilities and, if hired, the wages of male workers who have previously become unemployed as the result of an establishment closure. To identify the causal effect of an individual worker's network on labour market outcomes, I exploit exogenous variation in the strength of these networks that is due to the occurrence of mass-layoffs in the establishments of former coworkers. The empirical analysis is based on administrative data that comprise the universe of workers employed in Germany between 1980 and 2001. The results suggest a strong positive effect of a higher employment rate in a worker's network of former coworkers on his re-employment probability after displacement: a 10 percentage point increase in the prevailing employment rate in the network increases the re-employment probability by 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, there is no evidence of a statistically significant effect on wages.</br></br>

<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper derives novel testable implications of referral-based job search networks in which employees provide employers with information about potential new hires that they otherwise would not have. Using comprehensive matched employer-employee data covering the entire workforce in one large metropolitan labor market combined with unique survey data linked to administrative records, we provide evidence that workers earn higher wages and are less inclined to leave their firms if they have obtained their job through a referral. These effects are particularly strong at the beginning of the employment relationship
and decline with tenure in the firm, suggesting that firms and workers learn about workers' productivity over time. Overall, our findings imply that job search networks help to reduce informational deficiencies in the labor market and lead to productivity gains for workers and firms.</br></br>

</br><h2>Ethnic Segregation in Germany</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper provides a comprehensive description of the nature and extent of ethnic segregation in Germany. Using matched employer-employee data for the universe of German workers over the period 1975 to 2008, I show that there is substantial ethnic segregation across both workplaces and residential locations and that the extent of segregation has been relatively stable over the last 30 years. Workplace segregation is particularly pronounced in agriculture and mining, construction, and the service sector, and among low-educated workers. Ethnic minority workers are segregated not only from native workers but also from workers of other ethnic groups, although less so if they share a common language. From a dynamic perspective, for given cohorts of workers, the results show a clear pattern of assimilation, reminiscent of typical wage assimilation profiles, with immigrants being increasingly less likely to work in segregated workplaces with time spent in the host country.</br></br>

</br><h2>How Do Industries and Firms Respond to Changes</br> in Local Labor Supply?</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper analyzes how changes in the skill mix of local labor supply are absorbed by the economy, distinguishing between three different adjustment mechanisms: wages, expansion in size of those production units using the more abundant skill group more intensively, and more intensive use of the more abundant skill group within production units. We contribute to the literature by analyzing these adjustments on the firm rather than industry level, using German administrative data. We show that most adjustments occur within firms through changes in relative factor intensities and that firms entering and exiting the market are an important additional absorption mechanism.

</br><h2>Immigration in Europe: Trends, Policies, and Empirical Evidence </h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
</div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
This chapter summarizes the main trends, policies and empirical evidence regarding immigration in Europe. We start by providing descriptive evidence on long-term immigration trends and current characteristics of the immigrant populations in various important European destination countries and Europe as a whole. We then discuss key policy issues in the European context, focusing on access to citizenship, asylum seeking, border enforcement, amnesties and policies to attract talent. In the second part of the chapter, we provide a survey of the large and growing literature on the recent European immigration experience, focusing on two key questions: what has been the socio-economic performance of immigrants in their destination countries and how has immigration impacted these countries' economies and native populations. We find large and highly persistent gaps in the economic performance of immigrants relative to natives in most destination countries, with only few instances of encouraging progress. Overall, there is little evidence of a detrimental effect of immigration on the economies of the host countries, which appear to respond to immigrant inflows through mechanisms more complex than simple factor price adjustments.

</br><h2>The Labor Market Impact of Immigration: <br/>
A Quasi-Experiment Exploiting Immigrant Location Rules in Germany</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
With the fall of the Berlin Wall, ethnic Germans living in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were given the opportunity to migrate to Germany. Within 15 years, 2.8 million individuals had done so. Upon arrival, these immigrants were exogenously allocated to different regions to ensure an even distribution across the country. Their inflow can therefore be seen as a quasi-experiment of immigration. I analyze the effect of these inflows on skill-specific employment rates and wages. The results indicate a displacement effect of 3.1 unemployed workers for every 10 immigrants that find a job, but no effect on relative wages.

</br><h2>Migration and Education</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a>
</div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Sjaastad (1962) viewed migration in the same way as education: as an investment in the human agent. Migration and education are decisions that are indeed intertwined in many dimensions. Education and skill acquisition play an important role at many stages of an individual's migration. Differential returns to skills in origin- and destination country are a main driver of migration. The economic success of the immigrant in the destination country is to a large extent determined by her educational background, how transferable these skills are to the host country labour market, and how much she invests into further skills after arrival. The desire to acquire skills in the host country that have a high return in the country of origin may also be an important reason for a migration. From an intertemporal point of view, the possibility of a later migration may also affect educational decisions in the home country long before a migration is realised. In addition, the decisions of migrants regarding their own educational investment, and their expectations about future migration plans may also affect the educational attainment of their children. But migration and education are not only related for those who migrate or their descendants. Migrations of some individuals may have consequences for educational decisions of those who do not migrate, both in the home and in the host country. By easing credit constraints through remittances, migration of some may help others to go to school. By changing the skill base of the receiving country, migration may change incentives to invest in certain types of human capital. Migrants and their children may create externalities that influence educational outcomes of non-migrants in the destination country. This chapter will discuss some of the key areas that connect migration and education.

</br><h2>The Economic Situation<br/> of First- and Second-Generation  Immigrants in France, Germany, and the UK</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
A central concern about immigration is the integration into the labour market, not only of the first generation but also of subsequent generations. Little comparative work exists for Europe's largest economies. France, Germany and the UK have all become, perhaps unwittingly, countries with large immigrant populations albeit with very different ethnic compositions. Today, the descendants of these immigrants live and work in their parents' destination countries. This article presents and discusses comparative evidence on the performance of first and second-generation immigrants in these countries in terms of education, earnings and employment.

</br><h2>Employment, Wages, and the Economic Cycle: <br/> Differences between Immigrants and Natives</h2></br>
<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">x</a></div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
In this paper, we analyse differences in the cyclical pattern of employment and wages of immigrants and natives for two large immigrant receiving countries, Germany and the UK. We show that, despite large differences in their immigrant populations, there are similar and significant differences in cyclical responses between immigrants and natives in both countries, even conditional on education, age, and location. We decompose changes in outcomes into a secular trend and a business cycle component. We find significantly larger unemployment responses to economic shocks for low-skilled workers relative to high-skilled workers and for immigrants relative to natives within the same skill group. There is little evidence for differential wage responses to economic shocks. We offer three explanations for these findings: an equilibrium search model, where immigrants experience higher job separation rates, a model of dual labour markets, and differences in the complementarity of immigrants and natives to capital.

In the first part of this paper, we present a stylized model of the labour market impact of immigration. We then discuss mechanisms through which an economy can adjust to immigration: changes in factor prices, output mix, and production technology. In the second part, we explain the problems of empirically estimating how immigration affects labour market outcomes of the resident population and review some strategies to address these.We then summarize some recent empirical studies for the UK and other countries. We conclude with an outlook on what we believe are important avenues for future research.

</div> <div class="modalContent"><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper summarizes the recent economics literature on the immigration wave experienced by Spain over the last decade. We survey this growing literature and focus on two key questions: what has been the socio-economic performance of immigrants in Spain and how has immigration impacted the native population. On the former, we conclude that there is evidence of large and highly persistent gaps in the economic performance of immigrants relative to natives in Spain. On the latter, the studies surveyed reveal substantial adaptations in economic choices of Spanish natives in a number of dimensions, including the labor market, household production, schooling, and the housing market.
